A transport management demo built with Laravel, Eloquent, and Filament. It manages companies, drivers, vehicles, and trips; provides availability calculations; and ships with a polished Filament admin dashboard and a comprehensive test suite.

## âœ¨ Highlights

- Filament admin with custom dashboard widgets
  - Active KPIs and resource availability
  - Monthly trips line chart
  - Trips by status doughnut chart (last 30 days)
- Availability engine (drivers/vehicles) with overlap logic
- Eloquent relationships for Companies, Drivers, Vehicles, Trips
- Trip scopes and computed properties (duration)
- Pest tests (Feature + Unit) for confidence and safety

## ðŸ§­ Domain Model

- `Company` has many `Driver`, `Vehicle`, `Trip`
- `Driver` belongs to `Company`, has many `Trip`
- `Vehicle` belongs to `Company`, has many `Trip`
- `Trip` belongs to `Company`, `Driver`, `Vehicle`

Trip enum: `App\Models\Enums\TripStatus` (scheduled, in_progress, completed, cancelled)

Computed property:
- `Trip::duration_minutes` â€“ difference between `start_time` and `end_time` in minutes

Scopes:
- `Trip::upcoming()` â€“ start time in the future
- `Trip::completed()` â€“ status completed
- `Trip::active()` â€“ scheduled or in_progress
- `Trip::status($status)` â€“ filter by status

Driver & Vehicle:
- `active()` scope for filtering active resources

Validation rule:
- `App\Rules\NoOverlappingTrips` â€“ prevents overlapping trips for the same driver/vehicle (inclusive bounds)

Availability service:
- `App\Services\AvailabilityService` â€“ returns available drivers/vehicles and upcoming trips per resource

## ðŸ“Š Admin Dashboard (Filament)

Location: `app/Filament/Pages/Dashboard.php`

Widgets:
- `ActiveTripsWidget` â€“ key metrics
- `AvailableResourcesWidget` â€“ drivers/vehicles available now
- `MonthlyTripsWidget` â€“ trips per month (last 12 months)
- `TripsByStatusWidget` â€“ trips by status (last 30 days, doughnut)
